I am a data journalist and analyst in Cincinnati, OH. My main interests include economics, '90s indie films, and Tony LaRussa baseball. When not making high caliber content on this site, I am usually running, cycling, or chasing the chimera of a perfect pancake. Futile so far. 

If you like data, stories, or hot takes on why the 2004 Cardinals were the best team in baseball, you're in the right place. If you're looking for [auto insurance](https://philazar.com), I regret to inform you that you are probably already disappointed.
