I am a data journalist and scientist in Cincinnati, OH. I began writing at St. Louis University High for the *Prep News* and continued on at the University of Illinois writing for the *Daily Illini*, *Buzz Magazine*, and the prestigious *Booze News*. 

My career has taken me into the sphere of data science and marketing analytics. I enjoy learning new statistical concepts, coding languages, and uncovering stories from data in all its forms. Here I get to stretch my legs and dip a toe into each of those passions.   

If you like data, stories, or takes on why the 2004 St. Louis Cardinals were the best team in baseball, you're in the right place. If you're looking for [auto insurance](https://philazar.com), I regret to inform you that you are already disappointed. 


Feel free to connect on [twitter](https://twitter.com/filetczar) or email me at azar.phil@gmail.com. I am open to conversation and business opportunities.
