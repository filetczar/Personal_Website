My name is Phil and I am a data journalist and analyst. Originally from St. Louis, I now live and work in Cincinnati for [84.51&deg;] (https://www.8451.com). My main interests include machine learning, R, and data visualization. Outside of work, I enjoy running, dark comedies and pancakes. 

I made this site to share data and the stories they tell with others. More on that [here](https://www.phil-azar.com/bloggin/).


This site was made using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
