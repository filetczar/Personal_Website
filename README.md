# Personal Website 
### This is a new project of mine in 2018. I will be blogging using Hugo/Bookdown and deploying on Netlify. 
### The general theme will be R data analysis vis a vis [Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot), [Fivethirtyeight](fivethirtyeight.com), and [pudding.cool](pudding.cool)
<br />
### For more information on creating a blog using Hugo/Blogdown using R, visit [Yihui Xie's great tutorial](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
