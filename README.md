# Personal Website 
### This is a new project of mine in 2018. I will be blogging using Hugo/Bookdown and deploying on Netlify. 
### The general theme will be R data analysis vis a vis [Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot), [Fivethirtyeight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com), and [pudding.cool](https://www.pudding.cool)
<small> But, an amatuer version :| <small/>
